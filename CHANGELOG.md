## 1.0.2 (October 7, 2021)

Improve the shutdown Behavior handler (#41)

* Update osc-sdk-go

This update is to fix the issue that DeleteOnVmDeletion was taken into
account when submitting the request to the API

* Reject misconfiguration

We cannot set shutdown_behavior to terminate and in the same time,
delete_on_vm_deletion to true for the launching device. The reason why
is because we stop the VM and then we perform the snapshot but in this
case, the volume is no longer available.

* Change the way we wait the VM

When the VM will be terminate, the state will never be 'stopped', in
this case we need to wait for 'deleted'

* Add tests for these fixes

- builder => reject when shutdown_behavior is terminate and
delete_on_vm_deletion is true
- acc => test that the snapshot is performed when the
delete_on_vm_deletion is terminate

* Fix compilation and test errors

* Refactoring of shutdown behaviors
